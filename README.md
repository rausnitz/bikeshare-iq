## [Cycletrack](http://www.rausnitz.com/track/) is a web app that provides live station-status information for bikeshare systems.

### Features

- The app records and stores station-status information from the past half hour, so you can see whether a station's current supply of bikes and open docks is increasing or decreasing, and how quickly.
- Choose between a map version and a text-only version.
- Each station has a text-only page with its [own URL](http://www.rausnitz.com/track/dc/31623). If you check a particular station regularly, you may prefer to bookmark its text-only page and quickly load that instead of loading a map interface.
- For tourists or others who don't want to download an app, it may be more convenient to visit a website.
