# [Bikeshare IQ](http://www.rausnitz.com/iq/) is a web app that provides live station-status information.

1. Choose between a map version and a text-only version, which loads more quickly on your phone.
2. Each station's text-only info page has its [own URL](http://www.rausnitz.com/iq/dc/now.php?s=31623). Bookmark it for the station(s) you check most, so your phone only has to load the information you need: the number of bikes and docks at one station in text, instead of a map interface showing hundreds of stations.
3. Bikeshare IQ records station status information from the past hour. There's a difference between a station that has had two bikes left for 30 minutes and one where the supply of bikes has been declining precipitously over that period and is down to two now. It helps to know.
4. For tourists or others who don't want to download an app, it may be more convenient to just visit a website.
5. Public bike-sharing systems don't necessarily need to pay a vendor to produce an app.
