Bikeshare IQ is a web app that provides live station-status information.

Q: Isn't there already an app for this? A: Yes, Spotcycle is a great app. That said, the premise behind Bikeshare IQ is the following:

1. It's extremely lightweight. Without having to load maps or graphics, you get the information you want to your phone quickly. Even after I eventually add a map version, the text-only version will remain the default.
2. Specify what info you want. Bookmark the results page for the station you use often, so next time you want to check its status, your phone only has to load a miniscule amount of information -- one station out of hundreds.
3. There's no app to download. For tourists or others who don't want to download an app, it may be more convenient to just visit a website.
4. More than just current status. Bikeshare IQ also records historic station information, so you know more. There's a difference between a station that has had two bikes left for 30 minutes and one where the supply of bikes has been declining precipitously over that period and is down to two now. Plan accordingly.
5. Public bike-sharing systems don't necessarily need to pay a vendor to produce an app that's based entirely on open data.
